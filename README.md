## Getting started
- Excellent review on 'traditional' methods for relational machine learning [1]
- Neat unifying framework for graph representation learning methods [2]

### Interesting repos
- Comprehensive implementation of TransX methods : [OpenKE]
- Python package for easy deep learning on graph : [dgl.ai]
